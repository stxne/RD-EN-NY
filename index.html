        <div class="essay-column essay-left scrolling-text">
            
            <p>Announcer: Two countries sharing the same small island but little else. They speak Spanish on this side of the river. They speak Creole over there.</p>
            <p>Announcer: One country embraced its European heritage. Man: Today, here, everybody says the motherland here is Spain. The other, its African roots. Translator: African origins are part of the national culture.</p>
            <p>Announcer: Haiti and Dominican Republic, an island divided. “Black in Latin America.” Captioning made possible by friends of NCI.</p>
            <p>Henry Louis Gates: It’s market day in Dajabón, here on the Massacre River, which separates Haiti and the Dominican Republic. The border hasn’t opened yet, but hundreds of Haitians try to beat the clock to set up their stalls first over here on the Dominican side.</p>
            <p>[Indistinct chatter]</p>
            <p>Finally, it’s 8 a.m., official opening time. The ancestors of the Haitians and the Dominicans have shared the island of Hispaniola for five centuries. This was the first place in the New World to import Africans as slaves. The island is the birthplace of the Black experience in the Americas. But standing here on the Dominican side of the border, the differences between the two countries couldn’t be clearer.</p>
            <p>It’s 8:00 on market day on this side of the river, 7:00 over there. They speak Spanish on this side of the river. They speak Creole over there. The people on this side of the river are proud to be part of a mixed-race society. There, they’re proud to be Black. Haitians and Dominicans have had many conflicts over the years. This river was the site of one of the worst massacres in the history of the Caribbean, and I’m here to discover how all this came about.</p>
            <p>[Band playing merengue]</p>
            <p>[Man singing in Spanish]</p>
            <p>Gates: I’ve come to Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, the oldest European city in the New World, the first in the Americas to import African slaves. Every Sunday evening, people come to the heart of the old city to dance merengue.</p>
            <p>The roots of merengue are as mixed as the people. It is the symbol of the Dominican Republic. Frank Cruz has been singing merengue for 67 years. </p>
            <p>[Cruz speaking Spanish] Merengue has changed a little. It is played faster now. Before, you could put your arm around a girl if you were in love. You would embrace her and dance closely together. Now one is over here, the other over there.</p>
            <p>Gates: The Dominican people are a rainbow of Blacks and tans and browns. What is it about the Dominican Republic that created the conditions for merengue to be born here? Merengue is a mixture of the music of the African slaves, the Spanish with their guitar, and the güira, which is Dominican. They mixed up their instruments to make a typical Dominican merengue.</p>
            <p>[Cruz speaking Spanish] It’s our music. We feel it is ours. This is our life. Without merengue, we can’t live. Merengue is the life, the soul of the people. </p>
            <p>[Cheering and applause]</p>
            <p>Gates: Santo Domingo feels unmistakably Spanish. Founded in 1496 by Christopher Columbus’ older brother Bartholomew, the city was the first seat of Spanish colonial rule in all of the Americas. Dominicans are especially proud of that Spanish heritage.</p>
            <p>In Columbus Square, opposite the first cathedral in the Americas, sits a monument to the man who first colonized this island. Christopher Columbus certainly has pride of place here in the heart of Santo Domingo, and it says something about the country’s sense of itself—Spanish, Catholic, and if not exactly white, then most certainly not Black either.</p>
            <p>I’m curious why there are no statues of famous Black heroes here, even though 90% of the Dominicans are Afro-descendants. How do Dominicans see their African heritage, their Blackness?</p>
            <p>Juan Rodriguez, an anthropologist, works for the Ministry of Culture as its director of cultural diversity. How would people describe you, given your beautiful mahogany color?</p>
            <p>Juan Rodriguez: Well, here I am as Indio. Indio? I’m supposed to be Indio here. Help me to understand. </p>
            <p>Gates: As an American, I’d never heard of this phrase Indio. Where does it come from? </p>
            <p>Rodriguez: Well, by the 19th century, we didn’t have any native indigenous people… No. Like in South America, so it didn’t apply to us, but it was a way to use the word Indio to actually negate our African ancestry and then became something else because, when you look at Dominicans, we cannot say honestly that we are Anglo-Saxon. </p>
            <p>Gates: If you look around—I mean, look at me. I am Black. You’re Black. Did you feel this way, Juan, when you were growing up, or did you have to learn that you were Black?</p>
            <p>Rodriguez: Actually—and I am sad to say—I had to learn to be Black. How did you learn? Well, I went to New York… That would do it. As most Dominicans. And all of a sudden, I felt that my roots were in Africa, not in Spain like here. Even today here, everybody says the motherland here is Spain. </p>
            <p>Gates: So who’s Black in Dominican society? In America, all these people would be Black, but here who’s Black? Negro. Rodriguez: Who’s Negro? I think nobody’s Negro here. If we are told, “You are Black,” “Oh, no. I’m not Black. I am something else.” Dominicans are in complete denial of who they are.</p>
            <p>Look at this. For Dominicans, this represents African heritage—Sambos. This is nothing but Sambos. So that explains why people—the way they portray Africans, why a kid would not say, “I am African.” Because that’s what they give you, that’s what they show you.</p>
            <p>However, they in New York explain what kind of mother… Gates: In the United States, most Dominicans would be considered Black, but here many call themselves Indio, a term unique in the Caribbean covering many gradations of brown, and when they think of the motherland, it’s Spain that comes to mind, not Africa, and these attitudes have their roots in the earliest days of the colony.</p>
            <p>One of the first sugar plantations in the Americas was located here in Nagua. Hundreds of African slaves worked this plantation, but the Santo Domingo sugar industry didn’t last long. Within just a century, the center of sugar production shifted to Brazil. To survive, the colonists abandoned the sugar plantations and turned to cattle ranching. That’s when the unique racial identity of Dominicans began to evolve.</p>
            <p>Frank Moya Pons is one of the Dominican Republic’s most eminent historians. </p>
            <p>Moya Pons: As cattle ranching became the dominant occupation, slaves had to be used as ranchers, too, and there was very little difference between the master and the slave. They both were riding horses, they both were wearing machetes. So master-slave relations became quite different from the rest of the Caribbean. You know, slavery in plantation society works differently than slavery in cattle ranching societies. Less antagonism between master and slave? Less antagonism, and the behavior towards the slave was different on the part of the masters.</p>
            <p>Gates, voice-over: After the collapse of the sugar industry, many white people left Santo Domingo. The colony increasingly depended on Black people and mulattos to fill the ranks of the army, the church, and the bureaucracy. They came to be known as whites of the land, and their loyalty was to the Spanish crown. As being the oldest colony, there was this myth that this was the most Spanish of all colonies in the New World, despite the fact that the population did not look Spanish, but if you look into the official documents, allof them, most of them normally claim “from the most Spanish and loyal city of Santo Domingo” or “colony of Santo Domingo.” That created, I would say, an ideological superstructure of Spanishness or Hispanicism, no matter how dark your skin was.</p>
            <p>Gates: But not everyone embraced this putative Spanish identity. There are places in Santo Domingo where the African cultural legacy proudly survives. The followers of the Holy Spirit of the Congo drums of Villa Mella are a unique Catholic brotherhood. They believe that the Holy Spirit miraculously gave their ancestors certain African musical instruments. </p>
            <p>Roman Minier is the head of the brotherhood. </p>
            <p>Minier: The brotherhood has been handed down from generation to generation. My great-grandmother, who was called Maximiliana Minier, was 12 when she was named the queen of the brotherhood of the Holy Spirit of the Congos of Villa Mella. We’ve had this tradition for over 500 years.</p>
            <p>Gates: This family has asked the brotherhood to commemorate the seventh anniversary of a family member’s death. UNESCO has declared the brotherhood part of the oral patrimony of humanity, a protected status given to endangered cultural practices. Some Dominicans reject their African heritage and are shy about claiming a Black identity. The reasons for this are rooted in their struggle for independence.</p>
            <p>Attención! On February 27, 1844, at Puerta del Conde, the Gate of the Count, patriots raised the flag of an independent Dominican Republic for the very first time. Professor Silvio Torres Saillant of Syracuse University showed me around Independence Park. Gates: Silvio, paint a picture for me. What did it look like here on that day in 1844? It was an old building which had political significance. It was here that people congregated to actually declare the official birth of the Dominican Republic. Hmm. Gates, voice-over: The Dominicans, however, weren’t declaring their independence from Spain but from their island neighbor to the west, the new Black country of Haiti.</p>
            <p>Haiti, founded in 1804 by former French slaves, occupied Santo Domingo in 1822. Haiti’s 20-year occupation had a profound impact on Dominican national identity. During those 22 years of Haitian unification or occupation, depending on your point of view, did the national character of the eastern part of the island change? National in terms of solidification of the idea of being a separate people. Yes, it evolved. You know, the Haitian government imposed French as the language of instruction. The Haitian government took particular actions against the church, economic actions against the Catholic church. The people here were a Catholic people. So the Haitian government was taxing the people and the institutions in the east. That is correct. And this angered everyone? It angered everyone, so in terms of people—Dominicans recognizing themselves as a people, you could say, yes, this is a period when that could be seen as emerging distinctly. They said, “We’re not like them. We’re a different people.” That’s right. Gates, voice-over: Once they freed themselves from the Haitians, many Dominicans did their best to reject just about everything about them—their language, their culture, and to some extent their color.</p>
            <p>Gates: So this is George Washington, John Adams, and Alexander Hamilton? That’s correct. In the center, you have Juan Pablo Duarte, who is the intellectual architect, if you will, of Dominican nationhood. So he’s the theorist. He’s the theorist. OK. So were they all white guys? Uh, he is a mulatto. Ah. He doesn’t look very mulatto in that statue. No, he doesn’t, and that reflects a tendency in the imaginary of the Dominican ruling elites, who have this tendency to want to whiten their heroes if their heroes are too Black. So they whitened the brother. Yes. Not only did they put him in marble, but they changed his features. That is correct, and that actually is a way of pointing to the complexity of race relations and the racial experience of Dominicans.</p>
            <p>Gates: In the early 20th century, the Haitians came back, not as soldiers this time but as desperate migrant workers. Most of them came during the United States’ occupation, which began in 1916, part of Woodrow Wilson’s policy of extending America’s influence in its so-called backyard. The Americans appropriated large tracts of land to expand the profitable sugar industry. But the wages were so low that few Dominicans would do the work, so they imported tens of thousands of Haitians.</p>
            <p>Saillant: Plantations dehumanized Haitian workers. They were reduced to a condition of total destitution. It is there that Dominicans learned to see themselves as superior to Haitians. In other words, the Haitians became the migrant workers, doing jobs that no self-respecting Dominican would do. That is correct. They became a new class. They became a new class. Because they were so homogeneous—because they were so homogeneous in terms of their hue, in terms of their phenotype, their Blackness became a type of Blackness which was different from that of Dominicans. So all of a sudden, the primary opposition became between us and the Haitians. That is true. That is true. So the Haitians then become a factor of Dominican identity.</p>
            <p>Gates: Blackness became a Haitian trait and a negative term to many Dominicans. Some Dominicans stereotype Haitians in the same way that white people once stereotyped African-Americans. Racism and anti-Haitian feelings reinforce each other as if Haitians are a completely different and inferior race. These beliefs were taught in schools and repeated through state propaganda until the late sixties. One man did more than anyone else to encourage these attitudes, the country’s president between 1930 and 1961, General Rafael Leonidas Trujillo.</p>
            <p>A cruel and corrupt dictator, Trujillo’s power over his people was absolute. Santo Domingo’s National Museum of History and Geography holds his personal effects. Wow! Look at that. This was his uniform? [Speaking Spanish] Yes. This was his formal uniform. Some of the things worth pointing out are the gold braids and the epaulets, also the belt where the sword would hang, which was a special and luxurious sword. Hmm. These suits were made in France. They have a very French style.</p>
            <p>Gates: Trujillo used anti-Haitian racism to help forge a strong state after years of political chaos. He did everything he possibly could to claim that the Dominican Republic was actually a white nation, despite the fact that even he had Haitian ancestry. All white. Not even mulatto. No. No. Blanco. Ah. Yeah. Jesus. Look at that. You would think it was Europe. Yeah. On his I.D.? He’s white. But he was a mulatto. Yeah. Like me. Like you. Uh-huh. He has makeup? He would powder his face, lighten? Ah. Yes. White powder. Ah. Like do you use? My goodness. I’ll be damned! Look at that. Yeah. The receptions…</p>
            <p>Gates: Trujillo’s anti-Haitianism reached its apex here on the Massacre River, which divides the two countries. Trujillo turned on the Haitian migrants, claiming they were encroaching on the so-called purity of the Dominican motherland. His victims included Haitian immigrants, Dominicans of Haitian descent, and Dominican-Haitian families. In October 1937, Trujillo issued an order for his troops to kill all the Haitians in the northwest part of the country. When his troops arrived, they closed the border. Even as the Haitians fled across the aptly named Massacre River, the troops brutally slaughtered them. In the end, approximately 15,000 Haitians lay dead. Trujillo never succeeded in entirely eliminating the Haitians. Today there are more than a million Haitians living and working here, a source of continuing tension. And like migrants everywhere, the Haitians have come here pursuing the dream of a better life.</p>
            <p>To a large extent, Dominicans’ ideas about race have been formed from their negative views about Haitians. I want to see what Haiti is like for myself, so I’m heading for the western tip of Hispaniola, to Haiti’s capital Port-au-Prince. Nothing, but nothing, prepares you for the devastation in Port-au-Prince. The earthquake that killed over 220,000 people has left 1.5 million people homeless. Entire families are living in tents with no electricity, no running water, and no sanitation. Long before the earthquake, Haiti was the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere… But even within this devastation, I can also see the courage and resilience of the Haitian people desperately attempting to rebuild their lives. It’s resilience born from an extraordinarily rich and noble history. Haiti was once a colony of France. Rising from the earthquake’s rubble, one can still see the monuments celebrating Haiti’s founding fathers and national heroes, but these aren’t the European colonizers I saw in the Dominican Republic. Rather, they’re Black men—the men who made Haiti the first independent Black nation in the New World, the first Black men in history to defeat their colonial masters in war.</p>
            <p>We’re all very familiar with the popular images of Haiti that we see on television—poverty, food riots, military coups, tremendous instability, and, of course, the devastating impact of the earthquake—but how many of us know anything at all about Haiti’s noble heritage, the fact that it was a center for the fighting of freedom in the 18th century and the fact that Haiti possesses one of the greatest cultures in the entire New World? That’s what I’m here to find out about.</p>
            <p>And despite the devastation, that culture is being maintained all over Port-au-Prince. At the partly destroyed National School for the Arts, I come across an extraordinary sight—young people still hungry to learn the arts practiced by their African ancestors.</p>
            <p>Gates, voice-over: Louis Lesley Marcelin, known as Zao, is the school’s head of percussion. [Marcelin speaking Haitian Creole] Haiti is a country of imitation. So many different ethnicities have come from Africa, and we Haitians have imitated them all, and that is why we have so many musical styles. For example, when you take a sect like Dahomey, a northern heritage, that is Dahomey Vodou, which comes from Benin. When you take Nago—which we inherited from the north, from Ghana Ewe that comes from Nigeria. Because we are descended from so many places in Africa, everything Africa had to offer, we inherited.</p>
            <p>Gates: Creole, the language most Haitian people speak, is partly based on 18th-century French, but it has strong elements from various West African languages.</p>
            <p>[Singing in Haitian Creole]</p>
            <p>Gates: To begin to understand the history of Haiti, I’m leaving the devastation of Port-au-Prince and traveling to the northern side of the island… to Cap-Haïtien, Haiti’s historic second city. Cap-Français, as it was then known, was the first permanent French settlement on Hispaniola. The French took advantage of the weakness of the Spanish in Santo Domingo to found their own colony in the west. When the island was formally divided in 1697, Cap-Haïtien became the commercial hub for the French side. It became the main port of entry for the growing trade in African slaves.</p>
            <p>The number of Africans shipped to Haiti during the slave trade is staggering—774,000, 300,000 more than came to the entire United States during the slave trade. Haiti was the richest colony in the entire New World. It was the jewel in France’s crown… The reason for this fabulous wealth—sugar. Walking around Cap-Haïtien’s historic market, it’s difficult to imagine just how important Haiti was to France. Haiti was known as the Pearl of the Antilles. By the mid-1700s, this colony, little bigger than Maryland, produced nearly half of the world’s sugar and generated two-fifths of France’s overseas trade. A brutally efficient plantation economy led to a very different way of life here than on the Spanish side of the island.</p>
            <p>Guy Alexandre, a sociologist, is also the former Haitian ambassador to the Dominican Republic. So he knows both countries well. </p>
            <p>In Haiti, there was a plantation economy linked to the exploitation of a large number of African slaves… whereas in the Spanish part, the slave rate was infinitely lower, and the economy was based on livestock. This meant there were major differences in the process of population formation, differences from the outset with a much higher rate of race mixing in the east than we had here. How does this difference between the countries and the people express itself in relationship, say, to traditional forms of Black culture, let’s say to Africa? The Dominican elite simply rejected, almost completely, the African component of their culture. The Haitians and, specifically, the Haitian elite accepted their African origins to the point where our African origins are part of the national culture. </p>
            <p>[Chorus singing]</p>
            <p>Gates: I’ve come to the village of Trou-du-Nord, just outside Cap-Haïtien, for the yearly celebration of the town’s patron saint—Saint James. Most Haitians officially are Roman Catholics, but that’s not all they are. Just outside the church under the town bridge, people practice a religion many Haitians combine with their Catholicism—the African-based faith Vodou.</p>
            <p>[Drums and singing]</p>
            <p>Hollywood movies with racist images of so-called voodoo dolls, zombies, black magic, and devil worship have demonized Vodou… but Vodou is a complex belief system, a religion as sophisticated as any other religion.</p>
            <p>Gates: In many of the New World Black societies, it’s not respectable to admit that you practice Vodou, but here, people are very proud, they seem to be. Of course, we are very proud. Why? In fact, we cannot even see ourselves differently. In fact, that’s the only way we see ourselves. In fact, I must say that what characterized the Haitian nation as a nation is the pride they have for their forefathers and for their heritage. When other people say, “Come on. You’re poor,” we know we are rich in our own ways. We are rich spiritually.</p>
            <p>[Drums and singing]</p>
            <p>Gates, voice-over: Max Beauvoir is a biochemist trained at City College in New York City and the Sorbonne in Paris. For the past 30 years, he’s been the Houngan, the high priest, of one of Haiti’s most important hounfours, or Vodou temples. Max believes that Vodou’s embrace of nature places it at the core of Haitian identity. Beauvoir: I would say it’s the aim, the aim of Vodou. When Vodou was constructed itself, the point was to include into it each group. Gates: Each African—so, in fact, Senegal was part of it. Mali was part of it. Dahomey was part of it. The Upper Nigeria was part of it. Southern Nigeria with the Igbos was a part of it. Once you have the northern Congos with Cameroon and Gabon, they were also part of it. So, in fact, I think that was the basic strength of Vodou. It was inclusive, embracing. Inclusive.</p>
            <p>[Hog squealing]</p>
            <p>Gates, voice-over: Like other oppressed people, the slaves drew solace and comfort from their religion. Vodou also gave them strength, courage, organization, and leadership, qualities that helped the Haitian people realize their greatest achievement—the defeat of their colonial masters, the French. In the countryside just outside Cap-Haïtien sits Bois Caïman, the Forest of the Alligators. Today it’s just a modest village. There’s nothing there to commemorate the momentous events that took place more than 200 years ago, not even a plaque. This is where the Haitian Revolution was conceived, a revolution that would result in the creation of the first free Black republic on earth… and it all began with a Vodou religious ceremony held on this very spot.</p>
            <p>Anthropologist Rachel Beauvoir, who is Max Beauvoir’s daughter, has researched the events of that night using oral accounts passed down for generations. Gates: Rachel, August 14, 1791. It’s midnight. Tell me what happened here under this tree. Thunder, lightning. The whole place is trembling. The earth seems to shake, and that’s when they get together in this Vodou ceremony, and everyone together says, “It’s over. Slavery is over.” They did a sacrifice of an animal, which was a black pig, and this sacrifice, everyone touched the blood, and this was the sacred oath that, above everything, liberty was most important.</p>
            <p>[Drums and singing]</p>
            <p>Gates, voice-over: The Haitian slaves confronted one of the most powerful nations on earth. For Black slaves to have the wherewithal to overthrow their white colonial masters was unthinkable. The principles of the French and American revolutions inspired many of the leaders. Many of the slaves drew their strength from the pride in their African past expressed in the belief in the power of Vodou.</p>
            <p>Gates: What was the role of Vodou in the revolution?</p>
            <p>Rachel: Vodou represented the cement that got all of those slaves coming from so many different areas, the continent of Africa—Haiti is like a microcosm of Africa… and the glue was Vodou. And the glue was Vodou, making sense of it all and making everyone make sense of every other one, and then they had the unity necessary to have the most powerful slave revolution in the whole world.</p>
            <p>Gates, voice-over: The Bois Caïman uprising marked the beginning of the greatest slave revolt in the history of the New World. It took the slaves just two years to win their freedom, forcing the French to abolish slavery. Haiti was run by the great general Toussaint Louverture, still as a French colony but free of slavery… but in 1802, the French, under Napoleon Bonaparte, reversed the emancipation of the slaves. Toussaint was tricked and arrested and then sent to a French prison, where he died in exile. The Haitians rose up against the French once again to stop the reimposition of slavery. At Vertières, just outside Cap-Haïtien, the Haitian forces, under Jean-Jacques Dessalines, Toussaint’s successor, routed the French army for the last time. This brilliant general, a former slave himself, was determined that slavery would never return to Haiti. </p>

            <p class="subhead">Me Quedo con la Greña: Dominican Women’s Identities and Ambiguities</p>
            <p>Over the years that I have conducted research in the Dominican Republic, natural hairstyles have come into fashion and a “natural hair movement” has gotten under way. It has heavily relied on the proliferation of images of black women who have decided to “go natural” and shared photographs of their process on Facebook pages, Instagram, websites, and blogs. For Carolina Contreras with her hair care business Miss Rizos and Patricia Grassal’s Go Natural Caribe, it was sharing these personal experiences online with other Dominican women that helped them launch successful businesses. Contreras’s social media project in particular, built first around her own natural hair transition and later her growth as a young entrepreneur, recast how Dominican women could imagine themselves. Her social media project has been to decolonize Dominicans’ relationship to their natural hair, reaching beyond the island to include Dominicans in cities in the United States and Europe.</p>
            <p>A plethora of images shared online work to counter the Dominican dominant visual discourse about black female beauty and what was previously acceptable. Dominican women have long been committed to presenting themselves with pin-straight hair that might elide any African heritage. Dominican salons on the island and throughout the diaspora have a reputation for their expertise in transforming black hair in this way. Hair is an important site of transformation of the body through which to conform to social pressures or confirm racial expectations—it is a key signifier used by Dominicans to distance themselves from blackness.</p>
            <p>“There are people who are enslaved by the salon and spend tons of money on it,” twenty-one-year-old Dulcina Abreu informs me.</p>
            <p>“The whole world here is enslaved by the salon!” shouts her friend Michelle Ricardo in agreement. Indeed, beauty salons are everywhere in the Dominican Republic and some  percent of women in Santo Domingo go to the salon every week.</p> 
            <p>“The salon, and the nail shop,” Dulcina goes on, “and I think many of the people could use the money to buy themselves a book that would help them with their careers.” The two young women express opinions I have heard numerous times among educated working-class and middle-class Dominicans in Santo Domingo in everyday conversation. They respond with frustration to a dominant culture that fetishizes a particular type of female beauty within patriarchal Dominican society. In addition, these young women complain that the culture that surrounds them is highly superficial. Dominicans invest in symbols of status: the brand of clothing they wear, the handbags they carry, and the straightening of their hair. Transforming one’s appearance is frequently more feasible and more socially acceptable than transforming one’s social position through educational attainment.</p> 
            <p>There is a mutually constitutive relationship between the elaborate microeconomic structure around which Dominican beauty salons are built and cultural standards about how Dominican women should look.4 In the Dominican Republic, beauty salons are almost exclusively owned by women.5 Salons have been so embedded in Dominican culture that for many little girls their first hair straightening is a veritable rite of passage. Often the beauty salon is little more than a tiny storefront, a sole swivel chair in front of a mirror at the back of an internet café, or a woman’s back patio (where the smoke from blow-dryers does not linger). The salon is such a ubiquitous space within Dominican culture that even if a woman does not invest in mainstream beauty practices, she is still likely to spend time in this important community space. Women and girls may sit and wait for hours for their turn to have their hair straightened in rollers, under “el blower.” By devoting time and money to physical appearance and racial transformation (producing a feminine Latina identity that conforms to social expectations), Dominican women increase their value within Dominican society. They are making astute choices in pursuit of social access and economic stability, but sometimes that looks like playing the lottery at the popular bancas throughout the country, or investing a great deal of money into their appearance for a chance of securing a better job opportunity or attracting a wealthy partner. In a neoliberal machista culture, can Dominican women empower themselves by investing more in education and less in their appearance, or does one’s physical appearance have greater social currency?</p>
            
            <p class="subhead">Fluctuations in Racial Meaning</p>
            <p>“Do you know who Martha Heredia is?” I ask each interviewee as I share images with them. I myself had not heard of Heredia until I moved to the Dominican Republic in 2010, right on the heels of her rise to stardom.</p>
            <p>“The one who won that thing, American Idol?” is twenty-six-year-old Sobeida’s response. “Did you watch when it happened?” I want to know. “No, it didn’t interest me. The saddest part was that the final day coincided with the date of the death of Luis Días,” Sobeida tells me, “and it irritated me so much that the newspaper came out with a column on the death of Luis Días and another one that announced that it was the final day of Latin American Idol. I was so irritated because I thought: she’s a stupid new star, who’s going to disappear in a short time and to give space to her cuts into the space of one of the most important artists that this country has ever had, a composer, un tipo completo, a revolutionary, a guy to whom we owe much musical credit.” Sobeida is correct about Heredia’s social significance by 2010: “Now hardly anyone mentions [her], like, she has disappeared, the fever has already disappeared.” Nevertheless, Heredia proved a fruitful site of analysis in how she represented Dominicanness to broad audiences that tuned in to the fourth and final season of Latin American Idol in 2009. What I heard from friends and interviewees was that Dominicans on the island and in the diaspora had gone wild in their support of the young singer from Santiago de los Caballeros and spent money texting in votes to ensure that she would win the competition, thereby securing a moment of national visibility in Latin America.</p> 
            <p>“Yes, everyone had this pride because she’s Dominican.” Sobeida confirms. “Even my dad said it was good to support Martha, so he sent in a text of support, to give his vote for Martha Heredia.”6 Perhaps Dominicans also looked to Heredia to represent Dominican national pride because she looked like them with her brown skin and straightened hair. By placing her image alongside those of Zoe Saldaña, Rita Indiana, and Michelle Rodriguez, I drew out many conversations about class and color that would not have otherwise emerged. Although in my mind (and to my eyes) Heredia was quite similar to Saldaña in color, how she was read by interviewees in terms of color was quite different. She was born in Santiago, yet to Dominican audiences she represented the working class and Dominicanyork (Dominican immigrant to New York) in her aesthetic in ways that Saldaña, as an established Hollywood movie star, did not.</p>
            <p>With the images laid on the table in front of Sobeida, I suggest, “We could say, academically, about the phenotype of the women here…that you have to decide what color Zoe is, in comparison to Martha. And I know it’s a bit difficult because these are photographs printed on paper, but there are some things you can say about her phenotype that are revealed.”</p>
            <p>Sobeida responds, “Zoe Saldaña, I think she’s more mixed, because of her hair…because of her hair and her nose. The other [Heredia] looks more like an average Dominican, I dunno, like one of those that you see out there on the street, with her straightened hair so ugly—with her afro treated…and her little nose. I think the two of them seem to me to be the most dominicana… Zoe is a little more fair…Here the women who look a little like Zoe are in the Cibao, in the central region of the country, where there was the most racial mixture in comparison with other regions. There are more whites in the Cibao or quote unquote ‘whites’ than in other areas of the country.” Specificities of region are also revealed through my use of images. When I say to Sobeida that it seems like in her description of these women and the differences among them that there was some attention to class, she responds, “A difference in class? You think so?”</p>
            <p>“Yes, because she,” I say, pointing to a picture of Heredia, “is a woman that you might see in the street every day, and she,” I say as I point to Saldaña, “is not.”</p>
            <p>“No, I didn’t say that you wouldn’t see Zoe in the street,” Sobeida says, pushing back at my misinterpretation of her words. “I said that her origin could locate her in the Cibao, but you can also encounter women like Zoe in the street…She [Heredia] looks mas pinta como de pobre…making her more Dominican, because most Dominicans are poor.”</p>
            <p>“‘Más pinta como de pobre?’” I ask, “What do you mean by that?” “That is to say, well, I’ll explain…Zoe appears to dress with better taste, she looks different; and she [Heredia] looks like one of those girls that has taken on a popular aesthetic, who looks like everybody else, like all [Dominican] women…like any woman you see on the street has that same aesthetic, the same hair, the same extra-long nails. Look, for example, Zoe does not have long nails. Esta tipa,” she says, pointing to Heredia “has those extra-long nails.” Sobeida offers a critique of the type of clothes that women like Heredia wear as provocative and revealing, even though I had only presented her with a headshot because there was always much more to the story than the image. And the image was just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
            <p>When I presented a sheet of paper that included an image of Rita Indiana alongside pictures of actresses Michelle Rodriguez, Zoe Saldaña, and singer Martha Heredia, I heard the same thing from many young women as they pointed to Rita’s image—“Culturally, I think she’s the most Dominican of the four.” Sobeida explained to me that this is much more of an ideological determination of Rita Indiana’s significance, since she is not in fact AfroDominican, or “verdaderamente dominicana [truly Dominican].” We are sitting at my dining room table in the stuffy, ground-floor apartment that I have rented in Los Jardines de Norte.7 Sobeida responds to my line of questioning about Rita as follows:</p>
            <p>“There was a lot of curiosity, and a kind of mythology around her has been created. There were many people, young boys especially, who wanted to see more, to know who Rita Indiana was, even though there were many fans who already know her…and in general terms, for whom, I felt, like a lot of closeness from the public, a lot of warmth; the public wanted to see [her work] and identified ‘con esa loca [with this weirdo]’ and it’s incredible, that this girl Rita comes to break through many taboos and so much bullshit. With that height with that skin color, it’s something else. And no, I don’t know to what extent they like her or are drawn to her physically for those uncommon traits, the people maybe see ‘something white in her’ if, like you say, Xiomara Fortuna could be as alternative as her, or represent as much rupture. I don’t know why but the people do not identify with [Xiomara]. Of course, Rita’s music is more commercial and uncomplicated, for youth. Xiomara being Afro-Dominican invites reflections and romance and young people don’t always respond positively to that. Xiomara had many problems because they said that she was black, that she was una bruja [a witch], I dunno. And this girl [Rita] doesn’t have that. She doesn’t have this ‘problem’ of negritude.”</p>
            <p> Sobeida’s comments emphasize Rita Indiana’s Otherness in terms of her height and color, an observation that was regularly remarked upon in other interviews, and something that stands out visually as much as her queerness or marker of ambiguously representing “una loca.” Although she breaks taboos to a degree, Rita’s whiteness is not stigmatizing in the ways that Sobeida—who was responding to my own juxtaposition of the two popular artists—suggests Fortuna’s Afro-Dominican rhythms, practices, and representation have been.</p>
            <p>Rita’s sophisticated deployment of Dominican sound and language that is racialized as black seems to allow her to shift her firmly established Dominican identity toward queerness, with less of a social cost. Dominican audiences dismissive of Afro-Dominican culture produced by black bodies are willing to embrace black culture packaged in this way. Says Sobeida: “And they know she is a lesbian and they applaud. Yes, for me that was motivating. I think that the constructions of homophobia and of heteronormativity cannot…can’t always be imposed and many myths can be deconstructed and wits territory, typically that of the artist, it is acceptable by viewers and cultural consumers. I ask Sobeida directly about her reading of Rita in the photo in front of us because I want to determine a scale through which to talk about difference and whether we are seeing the same thing or have disparate understandings of Rita’s racial meaning. “So, is she white or not?” I ask.  “Yes, I think she’s white. She is from families that are rich and white.” Sobeida’s response demonstrates how the appearance of whiteness in the Dominican Republic may need to be confirmed by lineage even as it is assessed through the visual image. Class becomes the qualifier for Dominican whiteness. I push to understand the color hierarchy that she sees in my set of images because initially when I showed her my four photos she also told me that the two women that were most Dominican were the morenas (Zoe Saldaña and Martha Heredia) and that in the fourth image Michelle Rodriguez “looked very white.” Sobeida explains, “Yes, in this photo she appears very white and maybe because of that I said she seems less Dominican for that reason and because, the truth is, I don’t know much about Michelle Rodriguez. But I think since I did not know much about her coming here or her having some important contact with this country, that’s why I think she’s not very Dominican.” Narrative, or lack thereof, is determining how Sobeida sees Rodriguez’s identity—and how she interprets her image. Her comments also reflect the ways that knowing someone is Dominican serves to racialize them as nonwhite.</p>
            <p>When asked why she thinks Rodriguez is beautiful, Sobeida responds— candidly and without self-consciousness—based on the racialized measurements of the actress’s mixed-race body: “I think her smile is really pretty. Her eyes are very pretty. …She has a well-proportioned face. She does not have a very large nose, I dunno…her nose and eyes, she looks really good.” Sobeida’s comments are commonplace. Like others I interviewed, she suggests that Rodriguez’s features are European enough to appeal to the eye; a wide nose might signify too much Otherness or too much blackness. This response seems to echo a long history of active documentation of racial difference and racial assessment in the Americas, where part of the process of colonization involved cataloguing that which was new and different and making scientific conclusions about species and peoples, including demarcating racial mixture.8 At the moment of cataloguing, racial identity appears as if it is fixed, yet those of us who live in bodies that are of mixed racial heritage experience firsthand how highly dynamic a construct race can be.</p>
            
            <p class="subhead">To Be Black or Latina?</p>
            <p>“My first experience was a dilemma filling out a form at the YMCA in the US,” Yaneris tells me, describing her own challenges as an Afro-Latina in identifying herself within the social boundaries that invariably defined her as Other. She and I are sitting in her living room in Santo Domingo one evening.</p>
            <p>“To be Black or Latina? It’s like, ‘okay,’ I am not fucking Latina,” she laughs, “but I am not Black either, eh? What am I? I put Latina because geographically…it’s a geographic identity.” Yaneris is a dark-skinned Dominican woman in her early thirties. She has long dreadlocks that fall down her back—an exceptional aesthetic in the Dominican Republic. She agreed to participate in my research project only about six months into our friendship. She took her time deciding to trust yet another gringa researcher like myself who had come to Santo Domingo to write about race and the lives of others. My own privilege initially distanced us, and yet I soon discovered that we shared a black feminist politics that would bring us together on many issues. At the time, I did not recognize that we also shared in common an experience of straddling multiple categories of identity informed by the color of our skin. The moment of being forced to choose between two presumably disparate racial categories and racial identities that Yaneris described was familiar to me. During our conversation, I shared with her how my own experiences with this type of racial “dilemma,” as she called it, inspired my scholarly pursuits. The “what are you?” question inevitably lays a foundation for each story told about mixed-race experience in the United States. Accordingly, in the multiracial movement initiated in the US in the 1990s, mixed-race experience has been perceived as an anomaly probably because it emerges in the context of middle-class whiteness.9 How does a mixed-race narrative of identity emerge—and play out—in the predominantly mixed-race society of the Dominican Republic? Dominican racial logic frequently contradicts what US scholars think they know about how race works.</p>
            <p>“I have a book of Dominican races,” Yaneris tells me. “There are like, twenty-eight, and a census of slaves, from zambo to I don’t know what…E’ loco,” she says, “It’s crazy.” Yaneris has reevaluated her racial identity in numerous situations throughout her life, negotiating the line between blackness and Latinidad that Dominicans embody. “I can make a list of the things that people say are ugly and that which they say are pretty,” Yaneris says, explaining that blackness is always on the former list, never the latter. “It’s like many people say we are a mix, we are pretty, we are Taínos [native people of Hispaniola]…but it is mostly to say that we are not black, you know?” For generations now, Dominicans have been taught that they are “indio” in color, romanticizing their Indigenous past while rejecting their African heritage, regardless of the fact that the vast majority of Taínos were killed by Spaniards in the early years of conquest. While Indigenous identity is viewed as noble, blackness—signifying Haitianness—is highly denigrated and ever suspect.</p>
            <p>“Negra Latina…this is something new,” Yaneris says. The terminology is foreign in that the two racial identities might seem to cancel each other out in Dominican racial logic: a black Latina? It is “new” at a social moment in which the considerable number of people of African descent in Latin America has just begun gaining greater recognition. As an Afro-Dominican woman, Yaneris has often felt invisibilized in Dominican society. She says her racial identity has led her to self-censure. She keeps her observations about the daily racism she experiences to herself because her objections and concerns, along with those of other dark-skinned women in the Dominican Republic, are generally dismissed. In our interview she explains, “I can identify as Latin American but it is much easier [to identify as] as black.” Every day on the street people shout at her to get her attention, calling her by color: “Negra, how are you?” Dominicans are aware of her difference and do not hesitate to comment on it. Sometimes they use the term “morena” instead, which suggests blackness, too, though more politely. “It’s ambiguous,” Yaneris says about the term. Yet black bodies are perpetually associated with an African origin because of how we think about and recognize skin color as defining racial narratives.</p>
            <p>Black visual artists (and the white collectors of their work) have made an effort to contextualize Black art as part of a broader African diaspora, changing the meaning and value of the work and its style. African diaspora work, argues Kobena Mercer, is about representing the race, and working against a narrative of absence for black people. It is fascinating to consider Mercer’s gesture to the repeated use of the image of the African mask—a removable face, if you will—as tying together works of “Afro-diaspora modernism,” while the Dominican muñeca sin rostro, symbolic of racial ambiguity in the African diaspora, requires the erasure of a face. It is not that Africannes can be taken on and off but rather it requires signifiers in order to be legible.</p>
            <p> For Yaneris, a dark-skinned Dominican woman, those who view her often make decisions for her about her racial identity. She faces discrimination at the intersections of blackness and queerness. As Dulce Reyes Bonilla reminds us regarding the experiences of dark-skinned queer dominicanas, “Day by day there is a struggle to fit in to places in which one belongs, which creates a feeling of not belonging anywhere. Every day decisions have to be made about what aspect of one’s identity would dominate at which moment.” The language of ambiguity reflects the unspoken contradictions around race and identity and challenges of belonging that Dominicans negotiate daily. We cannot avoid seeing the racial meaning of black and brown bodies even if the meaning of what we see can see/saw from one moment to the next as we articulate what we are seeing; these are the very moments in which we produce “mixed race.”</p>
            
            
            <p class="subhead">Navigating a Transnational World?</p>
            <p>One story Michelle narrates for me is about an experience while living with family in Texas. She boarded the wrong bus one day and ended up in a part of town that she described as “muy creepy.” She found herself out of her element in a poor African American neighborhood when a Black man at the bus stop asked her, “Where are you from?” When she responded with “I’m Dominican,” he told her, “I thought you were from here [the United States]…I thought you were from Florida.” Michelle tells me that this brief interaction revealed a lot to her about US preoccupations with race and difference. In that moment, she understood that she was being read within a different racial framework from her own. “I said ‘no,’ I was not from Florida,” she explains. “It was at this moment I realized that everyone thought I was a Black woman. Now I wasn’t Latina. I wasn’t Latina because I wasn’t Mexican. I was Black.” The man who spoke to her was aware of her foreignness, and asked the standard questions that racially mixed and racially ambiguous people are asked: “What are you?” and “Where are you from?” In this case, the man tried to contextualize Michelle, to make racial meaning, within the bounds of the United States. What Michelle realized in that moment of interaction was that it was possible to move across racial categories depending on one’s social location—even just relocating your body across town and into a Black neighborhood. The moment was memorable because it changed how she understood herself in the world; she came into consciousness about her own racial ambiguity.</p>
            <p>Michelle jokes with Dulcina and me about how illogical racial constructs are: “Whatever part of the world I go to, I am going to say no, I have a white ancestor so I am white. . . . because people here say this.” We all laugh together at the thought of this truth.</p>
            <p>“You are white because you have a great-grandfather, or great-greatgrandfather who is white. Spanish or German…they say that here,” adds Dulcina. “Imagine me going to Finland and saying, ‘I’m white!’” she says. We have a good laugh about what we know to be true about the how race does and does not work, each of us understanding its instability because of our experiences of racial ambiguity while crossing national borders.</p>
            <p> Michelle also recognizes the influence of African American culture in the Dominican Republic—namely through New York City and hip-hop music in which Dominicans in the barrios have seen themselves since the 1980s. Now they identify with the marginalization of African Americans, she explains. “This you can see with the boys in the barrios, they began to assimilate themselves as Black…Of course, not the same black as the Haitian, but they, too, in the barrio, began to assimilate like a group of people that aren’t white.” As she describes it, the poverty of the barrios of Santo Domingo “blackens” Dominicans.</p>
            <p>“Ultimately, we are never going to assimilate as black people,” Michelle concedes. “Maybe not white, but not black…Like in my poem, ‘Como indios, no indigena’…here there are so many indios because there are no blacks,” says Michelle, frustrated. She is openly critical of Dominican desires to distance themselves from blackness. While she enjoys privilege because of her color and her class, she is also familiar with outsider status.</p>
            <p>“It is strange that we haven’t revolutionized this,” Dulcina offers, suggesting that these concepts of race in the Dominican Republic have not moved forward, as if there is a clear, linear direction for ideological change that looks like other development projects in the country. She has her own stories and experiences of being racially misinterpreted. She is a Dominican of Iranian descent, with light skin and long, thick, brown hair that falls nearly straight down her back. “Before people thought I was Spanish. Now people think I am from the Orient, my father is from the Orient. Before, it was Spanish or Arab…Spanish or Turkish. Never placed…but now the people are assimilating more things, more culture.” She says someone finally identified her as being of Iranian descent because they actually knew of Iran and therefore they could conceive of her identity. Dulcina, who is quite similar in coloring to Michelle, is not simply viewed as “black,” rather she carries with her a Dominican national identity and a narrative of Dominican immigration that intersects her racial and gender identity, informing how she is perceived abroad. Unlike the experience of non-ambiguously racialized immigrants, however, she is well aware that variables based on context could allow her to “assimilate” into different countries differently. Because immigration is so much about the movement of labor, racially ambiguous bodies have more options for such movement; they change shape and meaning within a global capitalist culture.The two friends also share a laugh about the culture of primary school in the Dominican Republic in which it is always the fairest students who are selected by teachers to play the lead roles in school performances. “And that was me,” Dulcina tells us. She was the one always chosen, the one always preferred over her darker-skinned peers.</p>
            <p> “You are white,” Michelle says to Dulcina in an accusatory tone, teasing her. Yet Dulcina, too, has traveled abroad and had experiences in which she definitely was not white. Like other middle-class Dominican youth, she has been to Europe. In countries such as Holland, Belgium, and Germany, she quickly learned that she was no longer white. She says that it was in Spain that she experienced the most discrimination. According to Dulcina, there are many women who travel there for work, who become domestic laborers. Employers want them to be attractive because they are “expected to use their sex appeal to advance themselves,” she says.</p>
            <p>According to Michelle, these challenges of daily life in the Dominican Republic, including the sexism and colorism, are integral to who the people are. It is such a hierarchical culture that people are submissive, unwilling to talk back to a boss. Obviously, doing so has real, negative consequences, so complaining happens behind people’s backs. For Michelle this is particularly frustrating because, as she says, “I am not a person that can keep silent.” She describes herself in school and in work as arriving on time and getting her work done, serious about the tasks at hand. Michelle earned her art degree from Altos de Chavón before leaving the Dominican Republic to study at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México.</p>
            <p>“Everyone knows that no soy facil,” she says. “I am a person who is very direct,” This has certainly been my experience with her.</p>
            <p>“Is this very Dominican?” I ask. “—No, it’s very my grandmother,” she responds with quick wit. “I don’t like to talk crap…Dominicans like to talk just to talk.” Digging into the broad generalizations, I ask Dulcina and Michelle about “this thing about the strength of the mujer dominicana, it’s a way of being in the world? Of getting what you want?” Dulcina says, “Yes, this is very powerful.” “Honestly, I think that yes,” said Michelle, “la mujer dominicana has an [advantage] and I don’t know if it’s just la dominicana, that’s all I know. She is a person…very strong. I consider…all the dominicanas that I have known to be luchadoras and they are very strong. I think it’s a question of survival. We are in a society machista. But here, las mujeres se comen en cualquier tíguere.” Women’s options are limited.</p>
            <p>To be clear, this is about nothing less than survival, these two young women explain. Dulcina educates me about the reality of trying to get work in an art gallery in the Dominican Republic: “You have to know people…and you have to be pretty.” As a woman, to get your work in a gallery, you have to sleep with the owner of the gallery, she tells me. At nineteen, she is well aware of the obstacles she faces to advancing herself in Dominican society. Like Michelle, she comes from a matriarchal household in which the women do not rely on men for support.</p>
            <p>Dulcina lays out the predicament that poor Dominican women are in: “I am young, I want a career, I have to marry con capo…Women now look for men who have a yipeta, not just men who can afford to buy them a stove and a washing machine the way it was in the past.” As Dulcina explains it, they are happy to have a man who can pay for everything for them. Because, what they quickly learn is that no matter how much a woman studies, when she is no longer pretty the boss will no longer want her. Just as unskilled labor is expendable, it seems that attractive young black and brown women as wives and girlfriends are too—particularly because so many are desperately trying to gain social access or just survive.</p>
            <p>“I have friends who say, ‘I am fulano’s woman,” Dulcina says, horrified by the way that the women describe themselves as little more than men’s accessories. They have learned, “I’m intelligent, but I’m a woman,” and so they focus on getting married in order to have economic security. “I don’t know if you have noticed,” Dulcina says for emphasis, “they start going to the salon…” I have noticed.</p>
            <p>“They reach an age of twenty to twenty-five at which they say ‘okay, I’m not going to make myself beautiful. I’m going to study. Now I have to marry, and I have to have two boys to keep a man tied to me so that he knows that if he divorces me he still has to support his kids.’” The familiar scenario was well-scripted in Dulcina’s head; Michelle corroborates it: “They have kids so that they have the money secured,” says Michelle, matter-of-factly.</p>
            <p> The two women talk about other women they know—and those they imagine—in ways that distance themselves from these same cultural values and experiences. Because of their racialized, classed, gendered realities and their perceptions of the world, which have been influenced by their education, class privilege, and travel abroad—but also because of the matriarchal families in which each of them grew up—Dulcina and Michelle struggle to imagine sharing these same cultural values around gender. They do understand what it is like to live within Dominican society and why other women make the choices that they do. No woman is exempt from the patriarchal structures that limit how men perceive her because of her gender, race, and class. Dominican women are encouraged by their families to have children no later than the age of twenty-five, which very often slows down or completely diverts any educational plans they may have had. Dulcina has said something in our interview that I had heard elsewhere in the Dominican Republic, about how Dominican women are already thought of as old and less attractive by the time they reach the age of twenty. It is of course women over this age who are better educated or have obtained greater life experience who are more likely to recognize and critique their own precarious social positions under patriarchy.</p>
